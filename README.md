libflatbuffers for Unikraft
===================

FlatBuffers depends on the following libraries that need to be added
to `Makefile` in this order:

* CXX standard library, e.g. `libunwind`, `compiler-rt`, `libcxxabi`, `libcxx`
* `libc`, e.g. `newlib

Please refer to the `README.md` as well as the documentation in the `doc/`
subdirectory of the main unikraft repository.
